feat(blockchain): record base‑block hash &amp; 
link previous state  
Introduce initial block creation logic: capture timestamp, compute SHA‑256 of payload.  
Establish previousHash field to enforce immutability across chain states.  
Prepare foundation for mining algorithm &amp; proof‑of‑work in next step.
