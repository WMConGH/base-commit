# base-commit
feat(blockchain): record base‑block hash &amp; link previous state  Introduce initial block creation logic: capture timestamp, compute SHA‑256 of payload.  Establish previousHash field to enforce immutability across chain states.  Prepare foundation for mining algorithm &amp; proof‑of‑work in next step.
